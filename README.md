A little utility that determines whether a word starts with a vowel or not. Useful for when you have to dynamically render text after indefinite articles

Still very naive but works ok for most cases.

# Install
```bash
$ yarn add starts-with-vowel
```
or
```bash
$ npm install starts-with-vowel
```
